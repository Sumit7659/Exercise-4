    <h2>Cultural understanding</h2>
        <p>A deeper cultural understanding can lead to more positive interactions, better collaboration, and truly diverse conversations. Given that Generation Z is often stated as one of the most diverse generations to date, there will be a wider variety of voices and perspectives in the future workplace. <br>

        Cultural understanding has been a key part of progress in most cultures. With international business, an important aspect of modern life, large companies in top industries are embracing and teaching this to their employees. Companies like Google, Novartis, and Coca-Cola are well-known for their diversity initiatives. <br>
        
        Since companies like these are often looked to as tastemakers, itâ€™s clear that by the time the next few generations are entering the workforce, this concept will be commonplace within most companies in the relevant industries.</p>
